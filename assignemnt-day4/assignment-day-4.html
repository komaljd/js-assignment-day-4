   <h3>
    Q. 6] rewrite the funciton using '?' or '||'
         write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. if the visitor enters another number->ask them to input again.
     </h3>

    the loop must ask for a number untril either the visitor enters a number greate that 100 or cancel the input/enter an empty line.
    Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs number. There's no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
